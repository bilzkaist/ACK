If the loss is not reducing, there are several potential causes and solutions to consider:

Poor model architecture: The model architecture may not be suitable for the task or not be able to capture the underlying patterns in the data. In this case, experimenting with different architectures or adding/removing layers may help.

Poor choice of optimization algorithm: The optimization algorithm used may not be effective for the task or the model architecture.

Insufficient data: If the dataset is too small, the model may not be able to learn the underlying patterns in the data. In this case, collecting more data may help.

Overfitting: If the model is overfitting, regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay, or early stopping can be used.

Poor initialization of model parameters: If the model parameters are not initialized properly, the model may not be able to learn effectively.

Learning rate too high/low: The learning rate may be too high causing the model to overshoot the optimal solution or too low causing the model to converge too slowly.

Checking the data: check the dataset, it might be the case that the model is not able to generalize well to new examples because the training examples are too similar to each other or too dissimilar to the examples in the test set.

It is important to try different approaches and experiment to find the best solution. It may also be helpful to consult with a more experienced machine learning practitioner for guidance.
