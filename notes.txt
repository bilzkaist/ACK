Data preprocessing: You would need to load and preprocess the data that you will be using to train and evaluate the model. This includes splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets, as well as formatting the data into the appropriate input and output formats for the model.

Defining the model architecture: You would need to define the architecture of the transformer model, including the number of layers, the number of heads, the number of hidden units, etc. You would also need to specify the number of input and output units for the model.

Training loop: You would need to write a training loop that iterates over the training data, updating the model's parameters based on the gradients computed during backpropagation. You would also need to specify the loss function that will be used to evaluate the model's performance, as well as the optimizer that will be used to update the model's parameters.

Evaluation: You would need to write code to evaluate the model's performance on the validation and test sets, and to compare the model's predictions with the ground truth.

Hyperparameter tuning: You would need to experiment with different hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and the number of training epochs, to find the values that work best for your specific task.

Finally, you would need to integrate the Ace in the Hole, King on the Field approach method to improve the accuracy of the model.
