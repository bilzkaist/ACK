# Ace in the Hole, King on the Field: A Multi-Path Neural Network for Indoor Localization  


Introduction:

Indoor localization is a challenging task that has many practical applications, such as navigation in buildings, tracking of assets, and monitoring of people's movements. However, the lack of accurate and reliable methods for indoor localization is still a major issue. One of the main problems is that the indoor environment is often complex and dynamic, with many obstacles and variations in the signal strength of the wireless signals used for localization.

To address this problem, this research proposal presents a new and novel approach for indoor localization that is based on a multi-path neural network architecture, called "Ace in the Hole, King on the Field." This approach is inspired by the idea of using multiple paths or branches, each with a different level of confidence, to handle different localization scenarios. The primary path, or "King," would be used for normal localization tasks and would be trained on a large set of labeled examples. However, if the network ran into a problem with localization that was hard or uncertain, it would turn on a secondary path, or "Ace," that was made to handle these kinds of situations.

The main objective of this research is to design, implement, and evaluate the performance of a multi-path neural network for indoor localization using a combination of deep learning and rule-based systems. The proposed approach will be compared with state-of-the-art methods to evaluate its performance and robustness in different indoor environments. This research will provide a new and novel solution for indoor localization that can be used in various applications and can help to improve the reliability and accuracy of indoor localization systems.


Objectives:

Develop a new and novel approach for indoor localization using a multi-path neural network architecture.
Implement a primary path, or "King," that is trained on a large dataset of labeled examples for normal localization tasks.
Create a secondary path, or "Ace," that is trained on a smaller dataset of more challenging or uncertain examples and can handle difficult or uncertain localization problems.
Evaluate the performance of the proposed approach by comparing it to existing indoor localization methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and scalability.
Investigate the potential of combining deep learning with rule-based systems to improve the performance of the proposed approach.

Methodology:

Develop the proposed multi-path neural network architecture using a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Collect and label a large dataset of examples for training the primary path (or "King") of the network.
Collect and label a smaller dataset of more challenging or uncertain examples for training the secondary path (or "Ace").
Train and fine-tune the network using the collected datasets.
Test the performance of the proposed approach on real-world indoor localization tasks and compare it to existing methods.
Implement rule-based systems and investigate their potential to improve the performance of the proposed approach.

Expected Outcomes:

A new and novel approach for indoor localization that uses a multi-path neural network architecture.
Improved accuracy, robustness, and scalability compared to existing indoor localization methods.
The potential of combining deep learning with rule-based systems to improve the performance of the proposed approach.
A better understanding of the challenges and opportunities of using deep learning for indoor localization.

Significance:

The proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy, robustness, and scalability of indoor localization methods. The use of a multi-path architecture and a combination of deep learning and rule-based systems could help to address the challenges of indoor localization and make it more reliable in real-world environments. This research could have a significant impact on a wide range of applications, including but not limited to, navigation, search and rescue, and asset tracking.
