# ACK: Ace in the Hole, King on the Field  


This approach is a new and novel neural network for indoor localization using the "Ace in the Hole, King on the Field" approach, which could be a multi-path architecture. This architecture would have more than one path or branch, and each path or branch would represent a different level of confidence. The primary path, or "King," would be used for normal localization tasks and trained on a large set of labeled examples. But if the network ran into a problem with localization that was hard or uncertain, it would turn on a secondary path, or "Ace," that was made to handle these kinds of situations. The "Ace" path could be trained on a smaller dataset of more challenging or uncertain examples and could use a different architecture or set of hyperparameters than the primary path.

Another approach could be to use a combination of deep learning and rule-based systems. A deep neural network could be used as the primary path (or "King"), and it would be trained to recognize patterns in the data and make predictions about the location of a device. However, when the network encounters a difficult or uncertain localization problem, it would activate a secondary path, or "Ace," which would be a rule-based system that would use pre-defined rules to estimate the location based on the data received.
